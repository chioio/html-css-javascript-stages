    <p>Here's a generic <code>p</code> element. It will be red.</p>
    <p class="example">
      Here's a <code>p</code> element with a <code>class</code> of
      <code>example</code>. There are two rules that could apply, but since the
      <code>.example</code> selector is more specific, this paragraph will be
      blue.
    </p>
    <p class="example example-2">
      Here's a <code>p</code> element with two classes: <code>example</code> and
      <code>example-2</code>. There are four rules that could apply to the
      paragraph. The first two are overruled by the more specific last two.
      However, because the last two have the same selector, the order breaks the
      tie between them: the one that appears lateer wins, and thus this
      paragraph will be green instead of magenta.
